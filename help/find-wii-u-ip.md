# Finding Your Wii U's IP Address

If you know your Wii U's IP address, you can connect to it with utilities like TCPGecko dotNet, JGeckoU, or other assorted Python scripts if you have TCPGecko active on your console, allowing you to run many different mods and hacks.

This guide will help you find your Wii U's IP address.

## Instructions

1. On the HOME menu, open up the Internet Browser. Make sure that TCPGecko/cafiine/geckiine aren't active, as they will freeze your Wii U if you try and open the Internet Browser. If they are, simply power off the Wii U and power it back on.
2. Open up a new tab by pressing the plus button in the lower right hand corner if you already have a website open.
3. Tap on "Settings" in the top right.
4. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and tap a button named "Enable Developer Tools". (Depending on your Wii U's region and/or language, the name of this button may be different.)
5. Tap "OK" when the dialog box pops up.
6. Tap "Enable" on the confirmation prompt.
7. You will see some text in the format ```http://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:9222```. In this case, ```aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd``` is the Wii U's IP address. Note this down somewhere.
8. Tap "OK" when finished.
9. Tap the developer tools button again, this time named "Disable Developer Tools". (Once again, depending on your Wii U's region and/or language, the name of this button may be different.)
10. Tap "OK".
11. Press the B button or tap "Back" to exit the Internet Browser settings.
12. If you opened a new tab earlier, close it now by tapping on the second button from the right and pressing the X next to "Start Page".

Please note that your Wii U's IP address may change in the future. If this happens, simply re-do the above instructions to find the new IP address.
