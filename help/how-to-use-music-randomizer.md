# How to use Music Randomizer

So, you want to use Music Randomizer and get custom music in Splatoon? Well, you've come to the right place!

#### Prerequisites/Requirements
1. A Windows PC
2. Your Wii U
3. The Music Randomizer itself. You can get this by downloading the SplatAIO (python version) and going into the Resources folder, then
the run folder, then the exe folder, then run MusicRandomizer. NOTE: MusicRandomizer IS VERY BUGGY AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS. BE CAUTIOUS!
4. You will also need your computer's IP. Use the ipscan24 exe in the same folder where music randomizer is at.
5. You need to turn off all firewalls and antivirus temporarily. It is recommended to turn it off permanently if you plan on using the
Music Randomizer often.
6. HAVE A WIRELESS INTERNET CONNECTION. WIRED CONNECTIONS CAUSE ISSUES.
7. ALL MUSIC HAS TO BE IN BFSTM FORMAT! I MIGHT ADD THE MP3/BFSTM CONVERTER AND DIRECTIONS FOR IT SOON!

$$$$ Steps to complete on the Wii U:
1. Open the Internet Browser and go to loadiine.ovh
2. In Loadiine.ovh, if you are using the dropdown view, choose Cafiine + Kernel from the dropdown. If you are using the list view, I
believe the correct option is to choose Cafiine.
3. Click submit and let it crash.
4. Reopen the Internet Browser FROM THE PAUSE SCREEN!
5. Go back to loadiine.ovh
6. Let it crash again
7. Don't launch Splatoon yet. Proceed to PC instructions.

#### PC Instructions:
1. Download the Music Randomizer by downloading the SplatAIO.
2. Extract the SplatAIO.zip
3. Go into the Resources folder, then the run folder, then the exe folder.
4. Look for a program called MusicRandomizer and run it.
5. If Windows Firewall asks you to allow the program, tick the box next to private networks and click allow.
6. Recommended but not necessary: click options then click Check for Updates. If no updates, proceed. If there is an update, download it.
7. Click Import file.
8. Click select, then choose where the BFSTM file is stored
9. Tick the box next to when you want the music to play. Note that there are multiple tabs, explore them!
10. When you have done that, click apply/save/done.

Now you should start Splatoon. If the game hangs/lags during the loading screen with the drums, this is normal. It might be because of
Cafiine's slow file transfer rate or the size of the BFSTM(s) you imported.
